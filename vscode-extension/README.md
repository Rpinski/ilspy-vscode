# ilspy-vscode (powered by ICSharpCode.Decompiler)

Welcome to the ILSpy extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides two commands inside Visual Studio Code:

- `ilspy.decompileAssemblyInWorkspace` - Decompile an MSIL assembly inside the current Visual Studio Code workspace.
- `ilspy.decompileAssemblyViaDialog` - Decompile an MSIL assembly from file picker dialog.

Open the Visual Studio Code Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>) then type `ilspy` to show the two commands.

The `Decompile IL Assembly in Current Workspace` will put all potential .NET assemblies
(files with extension `.dll`, `.exe`, `.winmd`, or `.netmodule`) in your
workspace in a list for selection.

The `Decompile IL Assembly (pick file)` command allows choosing an assembly using the file picker dialog. The dialog
should also allow one to type in the full path, for example, `c:/temp/a.dll` or `/home/user/b.dll`.

If the file is a valid .NET assembly, a tree view named `ILSPY: ASSEMBLIES` is added into the Explorer view.
It allows expanding and selecting various nodes, whose decompiled C# code is shown in the editor.

Loaded assemblies can be closed by hovering the assemly nodes and clicking the "X" icon.

Further features are:

- Symbol search across all loaded assemblies
- Choosing decompilation language
- Saving list of loaded assemblies along with currently open workspace
